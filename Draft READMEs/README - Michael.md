## Master Doc - Michael

This Trading Card Game is made to be a card game equivalent to the Role-Playing game, Dungeons and Dragons, on a virtual platform. Players will build a deck of virtual cards based around heroes, their characters, full of abilities, equipment/items, and spells that they will use cooperatively to fight monsters to earn gold (in-game currency) to purchase more cards. Each hero will have their own class, like their DnD counterparts, that will have special mechanics based on their class. 

•	Wizards - able to generate extra mana to dedicate to spell slots that will be used to spells specific to the class. Wizard spell slots carry over from one turn to the next.
•	Fighters – Able to play action surge cards that allow them another turn after their current turn.
•	Barbarians – able to play rage cards that allow damage dealt to them to be ignored until their next turn.
•	Bard – Able to play inspiration cards that function as another resource for special bard-only spells that can buff allies and debuff enemies.
•	Paladin – Able to play smite cards that can be used to boost damage or play the card “Lay on Hands” to heal one ally or revive a fallen ally.
•	Cleric – Able to play faith cards that allow them to gain faith as another resource for cleric specific healing spells
•	Druid – Able to play transformation cards to turn into various animals.
•	Ranger – Able to play companion cards which summons animal companions to provide assistance in the form of buffs
•	Rogue – Able to play sneak cards which gives Rogue critical damage on enemies for the duration of their turn
•	Warlock – Has the “Eldritch blast” card that can be modified with Patron cards.
•	Sorcerer – able to generate extra mana for card play and purchase spell slots like the Wizard, but their slots are only available for the turn on which they are purchased.
•	Artificer – Able to play special artifact cards that can be combined together to modify their capabilities.
•	Monk – Able to play Chi cards that generate Chi points which can be used to multiply the number of attacks a monk can perform in a single turn.
